🐍 Python Programming – Course
Course: Python Programming for Engineers
Institution: Tel Aviv University


📚 Overview
This repository contains solutions to a series of practical exercises in Python, completed as part of the Python course at TAU. The course was designed to develop core programming skills, algorithmic thinking, and hands-on familiarity with Python’s tools for data processing, recursion, object-oriented design, file I/O, and more.

🧠 Topics Covered
✅ Variables, Strings, and Conditions

✅ Loops and Iteration (for/while)

✅ Lists, Dictionaries, and Nested Structures

✅ Functions, Recursion & Memoization

✅ Object-Oriented Programming (Inheritance, Encapsulation)

✅ File Reading and Writing

✅ Exception Handling

✅ Global Variables and Scope

✅ Image and Data Analysis (PIL, Pandas, Matplotlib)
